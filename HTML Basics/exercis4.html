	<div><p>Well I'm not the world's most physical guy
		But when she squeezed me tight she nearly broke my spine
		Oh my Lola la-la-la-la Lola</p></div>
		<div><p>Well I'm not dumb but I can't understand
		Why she walked like a woman and talked like a man
		Oh my Lola la-la-la-la Lola la-la-la-la Lola</p></div>


	<div><p>Well we drank champagne and danced all night
		Under electric candlelight
		She picked me up and sat me on her knee
		And said dear boy won't you come home with me
		Well I'm not the world's most passionate guy
		But when I looked in her eyes well I almost fell for my Lola
		La-la-la-la Lola la-la-la-la Lola
		Lola la-la-la-la Lola la-la-la-la Lola</p></div>
		<div><p>I pushed her away
		I walked to the door
		I fell to the floor
		I got down on my knees
		Then I looked at her and she at me
		And I always want it to be that way for my Lola
		La-la-la-la Lola
		Girls will be boys and boys will be girls
		It's a mixed up muddled up shook up world except for Lola
		La-la-la-la Lola</p>
	</div>

	<div><p>Well I left home just a week before
		And I'd never ever kissed a woman before
		But Lola smiled and took me by the hand
		And said dear boy I'm gonna make you a man
	
		Well I'm not the world's most masculine man
		But I know what I am and I'm glad I'm a man
		And so is Lola
		La-la-la-la Lola la-la-la-la Lola
		Lola la-la-la-la Lola la-la-la-la Lola</p></div>
